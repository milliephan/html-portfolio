<h1>The Best Movies According to Millie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Sprited Away</h3>
<p>
  This is my favorite Miyazaki/Ghibli movie. I love the story that he creates.
</p>

<h3>The Craft</h3>
<p>
    This is like a witchy, Mean-Girls-esque, 2000s perfection
</p>

<h3>Over the Garden Wall</h3>
<p>
  If you want a haunting and nostalgic animation, but with cute and simple
  plotlines, this is the one for you.
